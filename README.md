## About Project
Task Day Scheduler is a daily planner application that works in real time to schedule future events, add important events and manage my time effectively.

HTML, CSS, Javascript, third party API.

## What to expect:
<p>when a user clicks on this <a href="https://usoyj.github.io/slogdayscheduler/">link</a> redirects you to a daily planner page, that displays the current date and time at the top of the calendar, when user scrolls down user is presented with time blocks for hours of 9am to 9pm, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future and user can enter an event and click the save button for that time block. The text for that event is saved in local storage, user refreshes the page and the saved events persist. view screenshots of website:
